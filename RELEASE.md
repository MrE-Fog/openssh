OQS-OpenSSH snapshot 2021-08-rc1
================================

About
-----

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.  More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

**OQS-OpenSSH** is an integration of liboqs into (a fork of) OpenSSH.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  The integration should not be considered "production quality".

Release notes
=============

This is release candidate 1 of the 2021-08 snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSH, released on August 8, 2021. This release is intended to be used with liboqs version 0.7.0.
